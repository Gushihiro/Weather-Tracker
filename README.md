# Weather-Tracker

I want to preface the README with an apology for lack of commits on this app. It slipped my mind to upload it due to constant work on our first project in the bootcamp.
This weather tracker application begins with just a search bar for simplicity. Upon looking up a city, a container appears on the right while slimming the searchbar to the left.
The container provides current information on the city's weather, including today's date, temperature, humidity, UV index, and wind speed. 
Below the current weather information is a brief 5 day forecast of the city's weather; providing temperature, humidity, an icon of clear skies, rain, or something else of the sort.
